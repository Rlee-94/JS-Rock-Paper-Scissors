# JS-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock paper scissors project involving vanilla JS code. 

I've created a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game with an interactive UI. Players can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and it will display who won the current round and keep score. Once the player or computer reaches five, an alert will trigger 'Game Over' and the webpage will reload. 

Will also show the ability to use git for pushing new changes and using a separate branch to make changes that merge back into the main branch.
